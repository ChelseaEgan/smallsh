CMake Error at C:/Users/Chelsea/AppData/Local/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/CLion/ch-0/172.3968.17/bin/cmake/share/cmake-3.8/Modules/CMakeMinGWFindMake.cmake:12 (message):
  sh.exe was found in your PATH, here:

  C:/MinGW/msys/1.0/bin/sh.exe

  For MinGW make to work correctly sh.exe must NOT be in your path.

  Run cmake from a shell that does not have sh.exe in your PATH.

  If you want to use a UNIX shell, then use MSYS Makefiles.
